## Generating Short Links

1. **Navigate to Short Links Page**: Select the [Short Links](https://wr.do/dashboard/urls) option in the navigation bar.
2. **Input Long URL**: Paste or type the URL you want to shorten into the provided input box.
3. **Generate Short Link**: Click the "Generate" button, and the system will automatically create a short link for you.
4. **Copy and Use**: Click the "Copy" button to copy the short link to your clipboard, and you can use it wherever needed.

## URL Stats

- **Clicks**: The number of times the short link has been clicked.
- **Visitors**: The number of unique visitors who have visited the short link.

WR.DO provides a simple access statistics feature that can be used to track the click count and visitor count of the short link.

## Expiration

- **No Expiration**: The short link will never expire.
- **Expiration**: The short link will expire after the specified time.

Once the generated short chain becomes invalid, it will not be deleted. When accessing the short chain again, it will be redirected to this page. Users can reset the short chain validity period to activate.
